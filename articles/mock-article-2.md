Computer, lights up! I'll alert the crew. About four years. I got tired of hearing how young I looked. The look in your eyes, I recognize it. You used to have it for me. What's a knock-out like you doing in a computer-generated gin joint like this? We know you're dealing in stolen ore. But I wanna talk about the assassination attempt on Lieutenant Worf. This should be interesting. Now, how the hell do we defeat an enemy that knows us better than we know ourselves? This is not about revenge. This is about justice. I think you've let your personal feelings cloud your judgement. Worf, It's better than music. It's jazz. That might've been one of the shortest assignments in the history of Starfleet. Your head is not an artifact! You did exactly what you had to do. You considered all your options, you tried every alternative and then you made the hard choice. I'll be sure to note that in my log. Damage report! The Federation's gone; the Borg is everywhere! Could someone survive inside a transporter buffer for 75 years? The game's not big enough unless it scares you a little. Wouldn't that bring about chaos? Your shields were failing, sir. I can't. As much as I care about you, my first duty is to the ship. We finished our first sensor sweep of the neutral zone. I will obey your orders. I will serve this ship as First Officer. And in an attack against the Enterprise, I will die with this crew. But I will not break my oath of loyalty to Starfleet. We have a saboteur aboard.
