## This is a test

I'll alert the crew. Mr. Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg ship. Captain, why are we out here chasing comets? This should be interesting. Fate protects fools, little children and ships named Enterprise. Now, how the hell do we defeat an enemy that knows us better than we know ourselves? Then maybe you should consider this: if anything happens to them, Starfleet is going to want a full investigation. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. A surprise party? Mr. Worf, I hate surprise parties. I would _never_ do that to you. You're going to be an interesting companion, Mr. Data. Congratulations - you just destroyed the Enterprise. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Did you come here for something in particular or just general Riker-bashing? Talk about going nowhere fast. I'm afraid I still don't understand, sir. A lot of things can change in twelve years, Admiral. That might've been one of the shortest assignments in the history of Starfleet. Well, I'll say this for him - he's sure of himself. About four years. I got tired of hearing how young I looked.
