_Caveat: this definition is based on my experience. This role gets written up in many different ways with tons of measurable and non-measurable expected outcomes. I highly suggest tailoring your definition of accessibility advocacy to fit the short/medium/long term needs of your organization._

_also Caveat: this is a definition I'm expecting to flesh out over a period of months (years?) and will periodically check back and update as my understanding expands._

## Who can be an Accessibility Advocate?

An accessibility advocate can be a mid to senior level developer or designer positioned on a user facing team of some kind. Experience and expertise in web accessibility **is not a requirement**. What's more important is motivation and enthusiasm for accessibility. Typically this unofficial role will be just one in a (sometimes long) list of responsibilities.

## What does an Accessibility Advocate Do?

An Accessibility Advocate has three main objectives:

1. Create awareness with team members and stake holders

- talk about the disabled user experience
- advocate for disabled users in cross-discipline meetings

2. Secure resources (budget, personnel, tools, testing)

- ensure accessibility testing and remediation are part of the release strategy
- make accessibility fundamentals an important part of hiring
- reach out for more specific/advanced accessibility testing needs

3. Center accessibility in the development and design process

- shift the accessibility conversation left and engage with design early
- be the “point person” for accessibility questions/concerns on your team
- push for continued testing and establishing a team wide culture of accessibility

## How can an Accessibility Advocate's Success be measured?

The observable benefits of accessibility advocacy will be felt in the medium to long term across the organization. Having a developer or designer working on a team consistently centering the disabled user in the conversation will absolutely result in a more inclusive outcome. [Measuring inclusivity](/measuring-inclusivity) if a broad topic, but in lieu of conversations with disabled users: reported problems, barriers, violations can be tracked across a team over time.
