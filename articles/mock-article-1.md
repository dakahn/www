Computer, lights up! I'll alert the crew. About four years. I got tired of hearing how young I looked. The look in your eyes, I recognize it. You used to have it for me. What's a knock-out like you doing in a computer-generated gin joint like this? We know you're dealing in stolen ore. But I wanna talk about the assassination attempt on Lieutenant Worf. This should be interesting. Now, how the hell do we defeat an enemy that knows us better than we know ourselves? This is not about revenge. This is about justice. I think you've let your personal feelings cloud your judgement. Worf, It's better than music. It's jazz.
